	abstract = {Vertebrate decomposition processes have important ecological implications and, in the case of human decomposition, forensic applications. Animals, especially domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), are frequently used as human analogs in forensic decomposition studies. However, recent research shows that humans and pigs do not necessarily decompose in the same manner, with differences in decomposition rates, patterns, and scavenging. The objective of our study was to extend these observations and determine if human and pig decomposition in terrestrial settings have different local impacts on soil biogeochemistry and microbial activity. In two seasonal trials (summer and winter), we simultaneously placed replicate human donors and pig carcasses on the soil surface and allowed them to decompose. In both human and pig decomposition-impacted soils, we observed elevated microbial respiration, protease activity, and ammonium, indicative of enhanced microbial ammonification and limited nitrification in soil during soft tissue decomposition. Soil respiration was comparable between summer and winter, indicating similar microbial activity; however, the magnitude of the pulse of decomposition products was greater in the summer. Using untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics approaches, we identified 38 metabolites and 54 lipids that were elevated in both human and pig decomposition-impacted soils. The most frequently detected metabolites were anthranilate, creatine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, taurine, xanthine, N-acetylglutamine, acetyllysine, and sedoheptulose 1/7-phosphate; the most frequently detected lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Decomposition soils were also significantly enriched in metabolites belonging to amino acid metabolic pathways and the TCA cycle. Comparing humans and pigs, we noted several differences in soil biogeochemical responses. Soils under humans decreased in pH as decomposition progressed, while under pigs, soil pH increased. Additionally, under pigs we observed significantly higher ammonium and protease activities compared to humans. We identified several metabolites that were elevated in human decomposition soil compared to pig decomposition soil, including 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoate, sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, and tryptophan, suggesting different decomposition chemistries and timing between the two species. Together, our work shows that human and pig decomposition differ in terms of their impacts on soil biogeochemistry and microbial decomposer activities, adding to our understanding of decomposition ecology and informing the use of non-human models in forensic research.},

	abstract = {Identifying the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution by comparative genomics is often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. The hemiascomycete yeasts, with their compact genomes, similar lifestyle and distinct sexual and physiological properties, provide a unique opportunity to explore such mechanisms. We present here the complete, assembled genome sequences of four yeast species, selected to represent a broad evolutionary range within a single eukaryotic phylum, that after analysis proved to be molecularly as diverse as the entire phylum of chordates. A total of approximately 24,200 novel genes were identified, the translation products of which were classified together with Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins into about 4,700 families, forming the basis for interspecific comparisons. Analysis of chromosome maps and genome redundancies reveal that the different yeast lineages have evolved through a marked interplay between several distinct molecular mechanisms, including tandem gene repeat formation, segmental duplication, a massive genome duplication and extensive gene loss.},

	abstract = {Soil samples from the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility (FARF) at Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, were analyzed for multiple soil characteristics from cadaver decomposition islands to a depth of 5centimeters (cm) from 63 human decomposition sites, as well as depths up to 15cm in a subset of 11 of the cadaver decomposition islands plus control soils. Postmortem interval (PMI) of the cadaver decomposition islands ranged from 6 to 1752 days. Some soil chemistry, including nitrate-N (NO3-N), ammonium-N (NH4-N), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), peaked at early PMI values and their concentrations at 0–5cm returned to near control values over time likely due to translocation down the soil profile. Other soil chemistry, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), orthophosphate-P (PO4-P), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+), remained higher than the control soil up to a PMI of 1752days postmortem. The body mass index (BMI) of the cadaver appeared to have some effect on the cadaver decomposition island chemistry. To estimate PMI using soil chemistry, backward, stepwise multiple regression analysis was used with PMI as the dependent variable and soil chemistry, body mass index (BMI) and physical soil characteristics such as saturated hydraulic conductivity as independent variables. Measures of soil parameters derived from predator and microbial mediated decomposition of human remains shows promise in estimating PMI to within 365days for a period up to nearly five years. This persistent change in soil chemistry extends the ability to estimate PMI beyond the traditionally utilized methods of entomology and taphonomy in support of medical-legal investigations, humanitarian recovery efforts, and criminal and civil cases.},

	abstract = {Genomic studies have estimated there are approximately 103–106 bacterial species per gram of soil. The microbial species found in soil associated with decomposing human remains (gravesoil) have been investigated and recognized as potential molecular determinants for estimates of time since death. The nascent era of high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the conserved 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene region of gravesoil microbes is allowing research to expand beyond more subjective empirical methods used in forensic microbiology. The goal of the present study was to evaluate microbial communities and identify taxonomic signatures associated with the gravesoil human cadavers. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon-based sequencing, soil microbial communities were surveyed from 18 cadavers placed on the surface or buried that were allowed to decompose over a range of decomposition time periods (3–303 days). Surface soil microbial communities showed a decreasing trend in taxon richness, diversity, and evenness over decomposition, while buried cadaver-soil microbial communities demonstrated increasing taxon richness, consistent diversity, and decreasing evenness. The results show that ubiquitous Proteobacteria was confirmed as the most abundant phylum in all gravesoil samples. Surface cadaver-soil communities demonstrated a decrease in Acidobacteria and an increase in Firmicutes relative abundance over decomposition, while buried soil communities were consistent in their community composition throughout decomposition. Better understanding of microbial community structure and its shifts over time may be important for advancing general knowledge of decomposition soil ecology and its potential use during forensic investigations.},

	abstract = {The necrobiome is the postmortem community that includes bacteria, fungi, arthropods, and other cadaver-associated organisms. It has been suggested as biological evidence for forensic investigation. Fungi form distinctive mildew spots in colonizing decomposing bodies, converting them into moldy cadavers. However, the postmortem fungal community consists of more than these visible species. Characterizing the succession pattern of the fungal community during decomposition is valuable not only for understanding the ecosystem composition of the cadaver decomposition islands but also for contributing to forensic investigations. In the present study, the fungal composition of pig cadavers and succession patterns during decomposition were investigated with high-throughput sequencing. The succession patterns were easier to discern in outdoor cadavers, compared with those that were placed indoors. The metabarcoding approach revealed trends linking particular fungal taxa with specific postmortem intervals (PMIs). Dominant species increased notably in cadavers and soil. Furthermore, the succession of the soil community was driven by the cadaver decomposition. Significant mycoflora differences were observed between environmental and cadaveric soil. The results obtained suggested that postputrefaction mycoflora have considerable potential for PMI estimation, particularly in cases that involve heavily decomposed bodies. In addition, the diversity of fungal communities revealed by the metabarcoding approach allowed us to discriminate the sites of cadaver decomposition, implying that postputrefaction mycoflora may be helpful in identifying the environment in which a cadaver has been placed, or the original location from which a cadaver has been moved. Our results provide an important step towards developing fungal evidence for use in forensic science and add to the growing body of work on postmortem microbial communities.},

We performed separate year-long human decomposition trials, one starting in spring, another in winter, integrating bacterial and fungal community structure and abundances with soil physicochemistry and biogeochemistry to identify key drivers of microbial community change. In both trials, soil acidification, elevated microbial respiration, and reduced soil oxygen concentrations occurred. Changes in soil oxygen concentrations were the primary driver of microbial succession and nitrogen transformation patterns, while fungal community diversity and abundance was related to soil pH. Relative abundance of facultative anaerobic taxa (Firmicutes and Saccharomycetes) increased during the period of reduced soil oxygen. The magnitude and timing of the decomposition responses were amplified during the spring trial relative to the winter, even when corrected for thermal inputs (accumulated degree days). Further, soil chemical parameters, microbial community structure, and fungal gene abundances remained altered at the end of 1 year, suggesting longer-term impacts on soil ecosystems beyond the initial pulse of decomposition products.},

              Considering it is common to find as much as 100-fold variation in the number of 16S rRNA gene sequences across samples in a study, researchers need to control for the effect of uneven sequencing effort. How to do this has become a contentious question. Some have argued that rarefying or rarefaction is “inadmissible” because it omits valid data. A number of alternative approaches have been developed to normalize and rescale the data that purport to be invariant to the number of observations. I generated community distributions based on 12 published data sets where I was able to assess the ability of multiple methods to control for uneven sequencing effort. Rarefaction was the only method that could control for variation in uneven sequencing effort when measuring commonly used alpha and beta diversity metrics. Next, I compared the false detection rate and power to detect true differences between simulated communities with a known effect size using various alpha and beta diversity metrics. Although all methods of controlling for uneven sequencing effort had an acceptable false detection rate when samples were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, rarefaction was consistently able to control for differences in sequencing effort when sequencing depth was confounded with treatment group. Finally, the statistical power to detect differences in alpha and beta diversity metrics was consistently the highest when using rarefaction. These simulations underscore the importance of using rarefaction to normalize the number of sequences across samples in amplicon sequencing analyses.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              Sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments has become a fundamental tool for understanding the diversity of microbial communities and the factors that affect their diversity. Due to technical challenges, it is common to observe wide variation in the number of sequences that are collected from different samples within the same study. However, the diversity metrics used by microbial ecologists are sensitive to differences in sequencing effort. Therefore, tools are needed to control for the uneven levels of sequencing. This simulation-based analysis shows that despite a longstanding controversy, rarefaction is the most robust approach to control for uneven sequencing effort. The controversy started because of confusion over the definition of rarefaction and violation of assumptions that are made by methods that have been borrowed from other fields. Microbial ecologists should use rarefaction.

An ungulate carcass creates an intense localized disturbance that varies with animal size and the season of death. Unlike other natural disturbances, carcasses deposit a concentrated pulse of nutrients into the soil. One year after death, inorganic nitrogen concentrations were significantly higher in the inner 50 cm at both adult and juvenile carcass sites than in surrounding prairie. Areas around a carcass became zones of fertility that favored different components of the vegetation and stimulated biomass production. Species richness and diversity at the center of carcass sites were lowest 1 year after death, but increased significantly in subsequent years. However, warm-season perennial grasses declined near the center of carcass sites and did not recover. Five years after death, ungulate carcass sites remained disturbed patches that harbored vegetation characteristically different in composition and stature from surrounding prairie. By providing a niche for species not normally found in undisturbed prairie, carcasses increased community heterogeneity and may play an important role in adding spatial complexity to grassland ecosytems.},

	abstract = {Mammalian decomposition provides pulses of organic matter to the local ecosystem creating ephemeral hotspots of nutrient cycling. While changes to soil biogeochemistry in these hotspots have been described for C and N, patterns associated with deposition and cycling of other elements have not received the same attention. The goal of our study was to evaluate temporal changes to a broad suite of dissolved elements in soils impacted by human decomposition on the soil surface including: 1) abundant mineral elements in the human body (K, Na, S, P, Ca, and Mg), 2) trace elements in the human body (Fe, Mn, Se, Zn, Cu, Co, and B), and 3) Al which is transient in the human body but common in soils. We performed a four-month human decomposition trial at the University of Tennessee Anthropology Research Facility and quantified elemental concentrations dissolved in the soil solution, targeting the mobile and bioavailable fraction. We identified three groups of elements based on their temporal patterns. Group 1 elements appeared to be cadaver-derived (Na, K, P, S) and their persistence in soil varied based upon soluble organic forms (P), the dynamics of the soil exchange complex (Na, K), and gradual releases attributable to microbial degradation (S). Group 2 elements (Ca, Mg, Mn, Se, B) included three elements that have greater concentrations in soil than would be expected based on cadaver inputs alone, suggesting that these elements partially originate from the soil exchange (Ca, Mg), or are solubilized as a result of soil acidification (Mn). Group 3 elements (Fe, Cu, Zn, Co, Al) increased late in the decomposition process, suggesting a gradual solubilization from soil minerals under acidic pH conditions. This work presents a detailed longitudinal characterization of changes in dissolved soil elements during human decomposition furthering our understanding of elemental deposition and cycling in these environments.},

	abstract = {As vertebrate carrion decomposes, there is a release of nutrient-rich fluids into the underlying soil, which can impact associated biological community structure and function. How these changes alter soil biogeochemical cycles is relatively unknown and may prove useful in the identification of carrion decomposition islands that have long lasting, focal ecological effects. This study investigated the spatial (0, 1, and 5 m) and temporal (3-732 days) dynamics of human cadaver decomposition on soil bacterial and arthropod community structure and microbial function. We observed strong evidence of a predictable response to cadaver decomposition that varies over space for soil bacterial and arthropod community structure, carbon (C) mineralization and microbial substrate utilization patterns. In the presence of a cadaver (i.e., 0 m samples), the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was greater, while the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Verrucomicrobia was lower when compared to samples at 1 and 5 m. Micro-arthropods were more abundant (15 to 17-fold) in soils collected at 0 m compared to either 1 or 5 m, but overall, micro-arthropod community composition was unrelated to either bacterial community composition or function. Bacterial community structure and microbial function also exhibited temporal relationships, whereas arthropod community structure did not. Cumulative precipitation was more effective in predicting temporal variations in bacterial abundance and microbial activity than accumulated degree days. In the presence of the cadaver (i.e., 0 m samples), the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased significantly with cumulative precipitation. Furthermore, soil bacterial communities and C mineralization were sensitive to the introduction of human cadavers as they diverged from baseline levels and did not recover completely in approximately 2 years. These data are valuable for understanding ecosystem function surrounding carrion decomposition islands and can be applicable to environmental bio-monitoring and forensic sciences.},

	abstract = {Vertebrate decomposition results in an ephemeral disturbance of the surrounding environment. Microbial decomposers are recognized as key players in the breakdown of complex organic compounds, controlling carbon and nutrient fate in the ecosystem and potentially serving as indicators of time since death for forensic applications. As a result, there has been increasing attention on documenting the microbial communities associated with vertebrate decomposition, or the ‘necrobiome’. These necrobiome studies differ in the vertebrate species, microhabitats (e.g. skin vs. soil), and geographic locations studied, but many are narrowly focused on the forensic application of microbial data, missing the larger opportunity to understand the ecology of these communities. To further our understanding of microbial dynamics during vertebrate decomposition and identify knowledge gaps, there is a need to assess the current works from an ecological systems perspective. In this review, we examine recent work pertaining to microbial community dynamics and succession during vertebrate (human and other mammals) decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems, through the lens of a microbial succession ecological framework. From this perspective, we describe three major microbial microhabitats (internal, external, and soil) in terms of their unique successional trajectories and identify three major knowledge gaps that remain to be addressed.},

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. Results: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.

	abstract = {Sulfonates and sulfate esters are widespread in nature, and make up over 95\% of the sulfur content of most aerobic soils. Many microorganisms can use sulfonates and sulfate esters as a source of sulfur for growth, even when they are unable to metabolize the carbon skeleton of the compounds. In these organisms, expression of sulfatases and sulfonatases is repressed in the presence of sulfate, in a process mediated by the LysR-type regulator protein CysB, and the corresponding genes therefore constitute an extension of the cys regulon. Additional regulator proteins required for sulfonate desulfonation have been identified in Escherichia coli (the Cbl protein) and Pseudomonas putida (the AsfR protein). Desulfonation of aromatic and aliphatic sulfonates as sulfur sources by aerobic bacteria is oxygen-dependent, carried out by the α-ketoglutarate-dependent taurine dioxygenase, or by one of several FMNH2-dependent monooxygenases. Desulfurization of condensed thiophenes is also FMNH2-dependent, both in the rhodococci and in two Gram-negative species. Bacterial utilization of aromatic sulfate esters is catalyzed by arylsulfatases, most of which are related to human lysosomal sulfatases and contain an active-site formylglycine group that is generated post-translationally. Sulfate-regulated alkylsulfatases, by contrast, are less well characterized. Our increasing knowledge of the sulfur-regulated metabolism of organosulfur compounds suggests applications in practical fields such as biodesulfurization, bioremediation, and optimization of crop sulfur nutrition.},

In turn, bile salts play a role in intestinal homeostasis by controlling the size and the composition of the intestinal microbiota. As a consequence, alteration of the microbiome–bile salt homeostasis can play a role in hepatic and gastrointestinal pathological conditions. Intestinal bacteria use bile salts as environmental signals and in certain cases as nutrients and electron acceptors. However, bile salts are antibacterial compounds that disrupt bacterial membranes, denature proteins, chelate iron and calcium, cause oxidative damage to DNA, and control the expression of eukaryotic genes involved in host defense and immunity. Bacterial species adapted to the mammalian gut are able to endure the antibacterial activities of bile salts by multiple physiological adjustments that include remodeling of the cell envelope and activation of efflux systems and stress responses. Resistance to bile salts permits that certain bile-resistant pathogens can colonize the hepatobiliary tract, and an outstanding example is the chronic infection of the gall bladder by Salmonella enterica. A better understanding of the interactions between bacteria and bile salts may inspire novel therapeutic strategies for gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary diseases that involve microbiome alteration, as well as novel schemes against bacterial infections.},

The genome of the α-proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 was interpreted to contain a nine-gene cluster encoding the inducible dissimilation of taurine, and this deduced pathway included a regulator, a tripartite ATP-independent transporter, taurine dehydrogenase (TDH; presumably TauXY) as well as Xsc (subgroup 3), a hypothetical protein and phosphate acetyltransferase (Pta). A similar cluster was found in P. denitrificans NKNIS, in contrast to an analogous cluster encoding an ATP-binding cassette transporter in Paracoccus pantotrophus. Inducible TDH, Xsc and Pta were found in extracts of taurine-grown cells of strain NKNIS. TDH oxidized taurine to sulfoacetaldehyde and ammonium ion with cytochrome c as electron acceptor. Whereas Xsc and Pta were soluble enzymes, TDH was located in the particulate fraction, where inducible proteins with the expected masses of TauXY (14 and 50 kDa, respectively) were detected by SDS-PAGE. Xsc and Pta were separated by anion-exchange chromatography. Xsc was effectively pure; the molecular mass of the subunit (64 kDa) and the N-terminal amino acid sequence confirmed the identification of the xsc gene. Inducible isethionate dehydrogenase (IDH), Xsc and Pta were assayed in extracts of isethionate-grown cells of strain NKNIS. IDH was located in the particulate fraction, oxidized isethionate to sulfoacetaldehyde with cytochrome c as electron acceptor and correlated with the expression of a 62 kDa protein. Strain NKNIS excreted sulfite and sulfate during growth with a sulfonate and no sulfite dehydrogenase was detected. There is considerable biochemical, genetic and regulatory complexity in the degradation of these simple molecules.},

	abstract = {Vertebrate carrion decomposition and nutrient cycling have both direct and indirect effects on the soil properties, fauna, and flora associated with an animal's carcass. While few comprehensive quantitative studies have been undertaken, those that have show considerable variability in decomposition processes and rates, their regulating variables, and the resultant ecosystem effects. In this two-part study, decomposition rates of vertebrate species were measured in a semiarid, shrub?steppe environment (Wyoming, USA). First, decomposition loss rates of mass, energy, and nutrients were measured for rat carcasses (Rattus norvegicus) in four seasons and two microsites (surface and underground burrows). Decomposition rates varied significantly between microsites (burrow {\textgreater} surface in spring and summer) and among seasons (spring {\textgreater} summer {\textgreater} autumn ≈ winter), with mass loss amounts linearly correlated with ambient air temperatures. Energy and nutrient losses were related to phased carcass organ/tissue losses, with energy, K, Na, N, and S being lost more quickly than skeletal components (P, Mg, Ca). Overall, the nutrient loss sequence was K = Na {\textgreater} N = S {\textgreater} P = Mg {\textgreater} Ca. Carcass quality (N concentration) declined through time as a function of decay stage. Second, decomposition rates of 10 vertebrate species (mule deer [Odocoileus hemionus], dog [Canis familiaris], white-tailed jackrabbit [Lepus townsendii], Uinta ground squirrel [Spermophilus armatus], least chipmunk [Tamias minimus], deer mouse [Peromyscus maniculatus], Magpie [Pica hudsonia], Sage Sparrow [Amphispiza belli], terrestrial garter snake [Thamnophis elegans], and northern leopard frog [Lithobates pipiens]) were measured with vertebrate scavengers present or absent. Mass loss rates varied among species and were generally faster in the presence of scavengers. Carcass body mass, N content, or labile/recalcitrant fractions did not correlate with decomposition rate, though surface area to volume ratios of mammal carcasses were positively correlated with wet-mass decomposition rate. Nutrient measures of sub-carcass soils showed soil N, P, and Na increased during decomposition. Increased soil nutrient amounts represented up to 15.6\% of the available carcass N, 28.8\% of carcass P, and 28.7\% of carcass Na. At a landscape scale in the shrub?steppe ecosystem, carrion decomposition constituted {\textless}1\% of the nutrient-cycling budget but contributed significantly to localized soil nutrient dynamics.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: High-throughput sequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes from marine environments is a widely applied method used to uncover the composition of microbial communities. We conducted an analysis of surface ocean waters with the commonly employed hypervariable 4 region SSU rRNA gene primers 515F and 806R, and found that bacteria belonging to the SAR11 clade of \textit{Alphaproteobacteria}, a group typically making up 20 to 40\% of the bacterioplankton in this environment, were greatly underrepresented and comprised {\textless}4\% of the total community. Using the SILVA reference database, we found a single nucleotide mismatch to nearly all SAR11 subclades, and revised the 806R primer so that it increased the detection of SAR11 clade sequences in the database from 2.6 to 96.7\%. We then compared the performance of the original and revised 806R primers in surface seawater samples, and found that SAR11 comprised 0.3 to 3.9\% of sequences with the original primers and 17.5 to 30.5\% of the sequences with the revised 806R primer. Furthermore, an investigation of seawater obtained from aquaria revealed that SAR11 sequences acquired with the revised 806R primer were more similar to natural cellular abundances of SAR11 detected using fluorescence \textit{in situ} hybridization counts. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a minor adjustment to the 806R primer will greatly increase detection of the globally abundant SAR11 clade in marine and lake environments, and enable inclusion of this important bacterial lineage in experimental and environmental-based studies.},

In this study, we sampled soil to 5 cm depth at distances of 0 cm and 30 cm from cadavers, as well as from control sites 90 cm distant, from five human and three pig cadavers at the Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Research (AFTER). We found that soil moisture, electrical conductivity, nitrate, ammonium, and total phosphorus were higher in soil directly under cadavers (0 cm), with very limited lateral spread beyond 30 cm. These patterns lasted up to 700 days, indicating that key soil nutrients might be useful markers of the location of the decomposition island for up to 2 years. Soil phosphorus was always higher under pigs than humans, suggesting a possible difference in the decomposition and soil processes under these two cadaver types. Our preliminary study highlights the need for further experimental and replicated research to quantify variability in soil properties, and to identify when non-human animals are suitable analogues.},

	abstract = {The postmortem microbiome has recently moved to the forefront of forensic research, and many studies have focused on the idea that predictable fluctuations in decomposer communities could be used as a "microbial clock" to determine time of death. Commonly, the oral microbiome has been evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess the changes in community composition throughout decomposition. We sampled the hard palates of three human donors over time to identify the prominent members of the microbiome. This study combined 16S rRNA sequencing with whole metagenomic (MetaG) and metatranscriptomic (MetaT) sequencing and culturing methodologies in an attempt to broaden current knowledge about how these postmortem microbiota change and might function throughout decomposition. In all four methods, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, but their distributions were insufficient in separating samples based on decomposition stage or time or by donor. Better resolution was observed at the level of genus, with fresher samples from decomposition clustering away from others via principal components analysis (PCA) of the sequencing data. Key genera in driving these trends included Rothia; Lysinibacillus, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and other Firmicutes; and yeasts including Candida and Yarrowia. The majority of cultures (89\%) matched to sequences obtained from at least one of the sequencing methods, while 11 cultures were found in the same samples using all three methods. These included Acinetobacter gerneri, Comamonas terrigena, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas koreensis, Pseudomonas moraviensis, Raoutella terrigena, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacillus cereus, Kurthia zopfii, and Lactobacillus paracasei. MetaG and MetaT data also revealed many novel insects as likely visitors to the donors in this study, opening the door to investigating them as potential vectors of microorganisms during decomposition. The presence of cultures at specific time points in decomposition, including samples for which we have MetaT data, will yield future studies tying specific taxa to metabolic pathways involved in decomposition. Overall, we have shown that our 16S rRNA sequencing results from the human hard palate are consistent with other studies and have expanded on the range of taxa shown to be associated with human decomposition, including eukaryotes, based on additional sequencing technologies.},

Desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) by Rhodococcus sp. and of aromatic sulfonates by Pseudomonas sp. has considerable biotechnological potential. Both these pathways require non-flavin-containing FMNH2-dependent monoxygenases (DszC/DszA and SsuD, respectively). FMNH2 is provided from the freely diffusible FMNH2 pool in the cell, and is replenished by specific NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductases (DszD and SsuE). Overexpression of the DszD FMN reductase in a heterologous system increases the efficiency of DBT desulfurization but is detrimental to cell growth at high levels. Expression of the sulfonatase that cleaves aromatic sulfonates (surfactants, dyes) is accompanied by synthesis of a thiol-specific antioxidant protein, which may protect the cell from superoxide radicals generated by autoxidation of the reduced flavin. Effective application of DBT desulfurization in the biodesulfurization of crude oil, and of arylsulfonate desulfonation in bioremediation, may require optimization of both flavin reductase levels and antioxidant protection systems within the cell.},

	abstract = {Summary The extracellular lipase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BD413 was purified to homogeneity, via hydrophobic-interaction fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC), from cultures grown in mineral medium with hexadecane as the sole carbon source. The enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and hydrolyses long acyl chain p-nitrophenol (pNP) esters, like pNP palmitate (pNPP), with optimal activity between pH 7.8 and 8.8. Additionally, the enzyme shows activity towards triglycerides such as olive oil and tributyrin and towards egg-yolk emulsions. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature protein was determined, and via reverse genetics the structural lipase gene was cloned from a gene library of A. calcoaceticus DNA in Escherichia coli phage M13. Sequence analysis of a 2.1 kb chromosomal DNA fragment revealed one complete open reading frame, lipA, encoding a mature protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32.1 kDa. This protein shows high similarity to known lipases, especially Pseudomonas lipases, that are exported in a two-step secretion mechanism and require a lipase-specific chaperone. The identification of an export signai sequence at the N-terminus of the mature lipase suggests that the lipase of Acinetobacter is also exported via a two-step translocation mechanism. However, no chaperone-encoding gene was found downstream of lipA, unlike the situation in Pseudomonas. Analysis of an A. calcoaceticus mutant showing reduced lipase production revealed that a periplasmic disutphide oxidoreductase is involved in processing of the lipase. Via sequence alignments, based upon the crystal structure of the closely related Pseudomonas glumae lipase, a model has been made of the secondary-structure elements in AcLipA. The active site serine of AcLipA was changed to an alanine, via site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in production of an inactive extracellular lipase.},

	abstract = {The processes associated with cadaver decomposition in outdoor settings, particularly those that occur during the extended postmortem interval ({\textgreater}30 days) are poorly understood. Thus, few methods are currently available to accurately estimate the extended postmortem interval (PMI). Of these methods, a soils-based approach has the potential to address the postmortem interval between which entomology and anthropology are the most valuable. Although the validity of soil-based methods has previously been established, little work has been conducted to explain the processes that have been designated for forensic application. As a consequence, we investigated the dynamics of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus-based compounds in soil beneath pig (Sus scrofa) cadavers (gravesoil) that were placed on the soil surface over a period of 100 days. Decomposition was assessed through the physical characteristics of the cadaver, soil pH, soil moisture content, and the concentration of total carbon, total nitrogen, soil-extractable phosphorus, and lipid-phosphorus in soil. Cadaver decomposition did not result in a significant difference in soil carbon and moisture content. However, significant (P{\textless}0.05) increases were observed in the concentration of soil pH, total nitrogen, soil-extractable phosphorus, and lipid-phosphorus. Based on the current results, a significant increase in the concentration of gravesoil nutrients represented a maximum PMI of 43 days (lipid-P), 72 days (total nitrogen), or 100 days (soil-extractable phosphorus). This work provides further evidence that a soil-based method has the potential to act as a tool for the estimation of extended PMI.},

We also provide one of the first analyses of RNA transcripts to characterize bacterial metabolic pathways during decomposition.

	abstract = {The ecological succession of microbes during cadaver decomposition has garnered interest in both basic and applied research contexts (e.g. community assembly and dynamics; forensic indicator of time since death). Yet current understanding of microbial ecology during decomposition is almost entirely based on plant litter. We know very little about microbes recycling carcass-derived organic matter despite the unique decomposition processes. Our objective was to quantify the taxonomic and functional succession of microbial populations in soils below decomposing cadavers, testing the hypotheses that a) periods of increased activity during decomposition are associated with particular taxa; and b) human-associated taxa are introduced to soils, but do not persist outside their host. We collected soils from beneath four cadavers throughout decomposition, and analyzed soil chemistry, microbial activity and bacterial community structure. As expected, decomposition resulted in pulses of soil C and nutrients (particularly ammonia) and stimulated microbial activity. There was no change in total bacterial abundances, however we observed distinct changes in both function and community composition. During active decay (7 - 12 days postmortem), respiration and biomass production rates were high: the community was dominated by Proteobacteria (increased from 15.0 to 26.1\% relative abundance) and Firmicutes (increased from 1.0 to 29.0\%), with reduced Acidobacteria abundances (decreased from 30.4 to 9.8\%). Once decay rates slowed (10 - 23 d postmortem), respiration was elevated, but biomass production rates dropped dramatically; this community with low growth efficiency was dominated by Firmicutes (increased to 50.9\%) and other anaerobic taxa. Human-associated bacteria, including the obligately anaerobic Bacteroides, were detected at high concentrations in soil throughout decomposition, up to 198 d postmortem. Our results revealed the pattern of functional and compositional succession in soil microbial communities during decomposition of human-derived organic matter, provided insight into decomposition processes, and identified putative predictor populations for time since death estimation.},

In addition to a better understanding of microbe-mediated decomposition processes, postmortem succession of human-associated microbial communities has been suggested as a possible forensic tool for estimating time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI). The objective of our study was to document postmortem changes in human gut bacterial communities. Gut microflora were repeatedly sampled from the caeca of cadavers as they decayed under natural environmental conditions. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that over time, bacterial richness significantly increased (rs = 0.449) while diversity decreased (rs = - 0.701). The composition of gut bacterial communities changed in a similar manner over time towards a common decay community. OTUs belonging to Bacteroidales (Bacteroides, Parabacteroides) significantly declined while Clostridiales (Clostridium, Anaerosphaera) and the fly-associated Gammaproteobacteria Ignatzschineria and Wohlfahrtiimonas increased. Our examination of human caeca microflora in decomposing cadavers adds to the growing literature on postmortem microbial communities, which will ultimately contribute to a better understanding of decomposition processes.},

Recent scientific breakthroughs in an initial study of the thanatomicrobiome have revealed that a majority of the microbes within the human body are the obligate anaerobes, Clostridium spp., in the internal postmortem microbial communities. We hypothesized that time-dependent changes in the thanatomicrobiome within internal organs can estimate the time of death as a human body decays. Here we report a cross-sectional study of the sampling of 27 human corpses from criminal cases with postmortem intervals between 3.5-240 hours. The impetus for examining microbial communities in different internal organs is to address the paucity of empirical data on thanatomicrobiomic succession caused by the limited access to these organs prior to death and a dearth of knowledge regarding the movement of microbes within remains. Our sequencing results of 16S rRNA gene amplicons of 27 postmortem samples from cadavers demonstrated statistically significant time-, organ-, and sex-dependent changes. These results suggest that comprehensive knowledge of the number and abundance of each organ's signature microorganisms could be useful to forensic microbiologists as a new source of data for estimating postmortem interval.},

	abstract = {Decomposing animals alter soil biogeochemical cycles, and these natural ephemeral nutrient patches (or 'hot spots') are important for maintaining landscape heterogeneity and enriching local biodiversity. Soil nitrogen (N) enrichment associated with decomposing animals has been documented, but to date an integrated systems-level understanding of the fate and rates of N compound transformations is lacking. The goal of this study was to develop a comprehensive view of temporal changes in N biogeochemical cycling during vertebrate decay. Vertebrate decomposition significantly altered soil N cycling, and was divided into three main biogeochemical phases based on soil chemistry. Phase one included initial and early decay, distinguished by oxic soils with low, background carbon and N cycling rates. Fluid release and insect colonization during active and advanced decay, defined as phase two, stimulated soil microbial communities, particularly those able to degrade phospholipids and nucleic acids. This resulted in anaerobic soils, 250 times greater ammonium and ten times greater carbon dioxide than background, and the highest N-15-enrichment rates. The final biogeochemical phase, encompassing the early and late skeletal stages, was characterized by enhanced nitrification and denitrification as evidenced by significantly elevated nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, and enhanced nitrous oxide release. As a result of decay and multiple synchronous processes, soil delta N-15 was enriched by 6-10 parts per thousand above background, demonstrating the influence of decay on soil isotopic signatures. This work provides a systems-level synthesis of N redistribution during animal decay and has significant implications for our understanding of nutrient turnover rates and dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.},

Although N2O producing inventory and pathways have been well-characterized using archetypal AOB, there is little known about their adaptive responses to oxic-anoxic cycling, which is a prevalent condition in soil, sediment, and wastewater treatment bioreactors. In this study, cellular responses of Nitrosomonas europaea 19718 to sustained anoxic-oxic cycling in a chemostat bioreactor were evaluated at transcriptomic, proteomic, and fluxomic levels. During a single oxic-anoxic transition, the accumulations of major intermediates were found at the beginning of anoxia (nitric oxide, NO) and post anoxia (hydroxylamine, NH2OH, and N2O). Anoxic-oxic cycling over thirteen days led to significantly reduced accumulations of NH2OH, NO and N2O. Distinct from short-term responses, which were mostly regulated at the mRNA level, adapted cells seemed to sustain energy generation under repeated anoxia by partially sacrificing the NO detoxification capacities, and such adaptation was mainly regulated at the protein level. The proteomic data also suggested the potential contributions of the newly discovered cytochrome P460-mediated NH2OH oxidation pathway to N2O productions. Flux balance analysis was performed based on a metabolic network model consisting of 49 biochemical reactions involved in nitrogen respiration, and changes in metabolic fluxes after the anoxic-oxic cycling were found to be better correlated with intracellular protein concentrations rather than mRNA levels. Previous studies focusing on single anoxic-oxic transition might have overlooked the adaptive responses of nitrifiers to anoxic-oxic cycling, and thus overestimated NO and N2O emission levels from natural and engineered nitrification systems.},

	abstract = {Soil salinization due to seawater intrusion along coastal areas is an increasing threat to rice cultivation worldwide. While the detrimental impact on rice growth and yield has been thoroughly studied, little is known about how severe salinity affects structure and function of paddy soil microbial communities. Here, we examined their short-term responses to half- and full-strength seawater salinity in controlled laboratory experiments. Slurry microcosms were incubated under anoxic conditions, with rice straw added as carbon source. Stress exposure time was for 2 days after a pre-incubation period of 7 days. Relative to the control, moderate (300 mM NaCl) and high (600 mM NaCl) salt stress suppressed both net consumption of acetate and methane production by 50\% and 70\%, respectively. Correspondingly, community-wide mRNA expression decreased by 50–65\%, with significant changes in relative transcript abundance of family-level groups. mRNA turnover was clearly more responsive to salt stress than rRNA dynamics. Among bacteria, Clostridiaceae were most abundant and the only group whose transcriptional activity was strongly stimulated at 600 mM NaCl. In particular, clostridial mRNA involved in transcription/translation, fermentation, uptake and biosynthesis of compatible solutes, and flagellar motility was significantly enriched in response salt stress. None of the other bacterial groups were able to compete at 600 mM NaCl. Their responses to 300 mM NaCl were more diverse. Lachnospiraceae increased, Ruminococcaceae maintained, and Peptococcaceae, Veillonellaceae, and Syntrophomonadaceae decreased in relative mRNA abundance. Among methanogens, Methanosarcinaceae were most dominant. Relative to other family-level groups, salt stress induced a significant enrichment of transcripts related to the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-coenzyme A synthase complex, methanogenesis, heat shock, ammonium uptake, and thermosomes, but the absolute abundance of methanosarcinal mRNA decreased. Most strikingly, the transcriptional activity of the Methanocellaceae was completely suppressed already at 300 mM NaCl. Apparently, the key taxonomic groups involved in the methanogenic breakdown of plant polymers significantly differ in their ability to cope with severe salt stress. Presumably, this different ability is directly linked to differences in their genetic potential and metabolic flexibility to reassign available energy resources for cellular adaptation to salt stress.},

We evaluated marine samples and mock communities (containing 11 or 27 marine 16S clones), showing alternative primers 515F-Y (5?-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5?-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) yield more accurate estimates of mock community abundances, produce longer amplicons that can differentiate taxa unresolvable with 515F-C/806R, and amplify eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Mock communities amplified with 515F-Y/926R yielded closer observed community composition versus expected (r2?=?0.95) compared with 515F-Y/806R (r2???0.5). Unexpectedly, biases with 515F-Y/806R against SAR11 in field samples (?4?10-fold) were stronger than in mock communities (?2-fold). Correcting a mismatch to Thaumarchaea in the 515F-C increased their apparent abundance in field samples, but not as much as using 926R rather than 806R.

	abstract = {The decomposition of animal carcasses contributes to nutrient recycling in ecosystems worldwide, including by delivering nutrients to soil. Although several studies have characterised changes in soil chemistry occurring under carcasses, many ecological studies have occurred over extended post-mortem intervals and fine-scale temporal changes in physicochemical conditions are poorly understood. We examined changes in a suite of soil physicochemical properties occurring under decomposing rabbit carcasses during summer in a grassland ecosystem. We found that carcasses lost over 90\% of their starting mass and reached dry decay and skeletonization after 20 days of decomposition. Carcass temperatures were up to 15 °C higher than ambient temperatures during the active decay stage (days 3 and 5) of decomposition. Soil moisture also increased by day 4, and this was matched with a simultaneous increase in total nitrogen and ammonium, as well increases in pH and electrical conductivity. Whereas these measures remained relatively stable as decay progressed, we found total phosphorus and phosphate continued to increase to day 20. The contrasting dynamics of N and P reflect the initial nutrient and fluid input during the rapid decay of soft tissues and intense activity of fly larvae, and the subsequent dry decay and exposure of skeletal components. Our study provides new information about the fine-scale timing of nutrient inputs and moisture and temperature changes occurring at the carcass/soil interface.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).Contact:mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

	abstract = {Abstract Taurine is a nonproteinogenic ß-aminosulfonic acid. Important dietary sources of taurine are fish and seafood. Taurine interacts with ion channels, stabilizes membranes, and regulates the cell volume. These actions confirm its high concentrations in excitable tissues like retina, neurons, and muscles. Retinal degeneration, cardiomyopathy, as well as skeletal muscle malfunction are evident in taurine-deficient phenotypes. There is evidence that taurine counteracts lipid peroxidation and increases cellular antioxidant defense in response to inflammation. In activated neutrophils, taurine reacts with hypochloric acid to form taurine chloramine, which triggers the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1?nuclear factor E2-related factor 1 (Keap1?Nrf2) pathway. Consequently, Nrf2 target genes, such as heme oxygenase-1 and catalase, are induced. Furthermore, taurine may prevent an overload of reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly by an inhibition of ROS generation within the respiratory chain. Taurine affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and taurine-deficient mice exhibit an impaired exercise performance. Moreover, some studies demonstrate that taurine enhances the glycogen repletion in the postexercise recovery phase. In the case of taurine deficiency, many studies observed a phenotype known in muscle senescence and skeletal muscle disorders. Overall, taurine plays an important role in cellular redox homeostasis and skeletal muscle function.},

	abstract = {Aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria were first isolated more than 100 years ago and hydroxylamine is known to be an intermediate. The enzymatic steps involving hydroxylamine conversion to nitrite are still under discussion. For a long time it was assumed that hydroxylamine was directly converted to nitrite by a hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Recent enzymatic evidences suggest that the actual product of hydroxylamine conversion is NO and a third, yet unknown, enzyme further converts NO to nitrite. More recently, ammonium oxidizing archaea and complete ammonium oxidizing bacteria were isolated and identified. Still the central nitrogen metabolism of these microorganisms presents to researchers the same puzzle: how hydroxylamine is transformed to nitrite. Nitrogen losses in the form of NO and N2O have been identified in all three types of aerobic ammonium oxidizing microorganisms and hydroxylamine is known to play a significant role in the formation. Yet, the pathways and the factors promoting the greenhouse gas emissions are to be fully characterized. Hydroxylamine also plays a yet poorly understood role on anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and is known to inhibit nitrite oxidizing bacteria. In this review, the role of this elusive intermediate in the metabolism of different key players of the nitrogen cycle is discussed, as well as the putative importance of hydroxylamine as a key nitrogen metabolite for microbial interactions within microbial communities and engineered systems. Overall, for the first time putting together the acquired knowledge about hydroxylamine and the nitrogen cycle over the years in a review, setting potential hypothesis and highlighting possible next steps for research.},

	abstract = {Decomposition of vertebrate remains is a dynamic process that creates localized soil enrichment zones. A growing body of literature has documented effects of vertebrate decomposition on soil pH, electrical conductivity, oxygen levels, nitrogen and carbon speciation, microbial biomass, and microbial successional patterns. However, relatively few studies have examined the microfaunal members of the soil food web that function as secondary consumers, specifically nematodes. Nematodes are often used as indicators of enrichment in other systems, and initial observations from vertebrate decomposition zones have indicated there is an effect on nematode communities. Our goal was to catalog decomposition-induced nematode succession and changes to alpha, beta, and functional diversity, and identify potential indicator taxa associated with decomposition progression. Six adult beaver (Castor canadensis) carcasses were allowed to decompose in a forest ecosystem for one year. During this period soil temperature, moisture, and electrical conductivity were monitored. Soils samples were taken at two depths in order to assess nematode community dynamics: 30-cm cores and 1-cm interface samples. Nematode abundance, alpha, beta, and functional diversity all responded to soil enrichment at the onset of active decay, and impacts persisted through skeletonization. After one year, nematode abundances and alpha diversity had recovered to original levels, however both community membership and functional diversity remained significantly altered. We identified seven indicator taxa that marked major transitions in decomposition progression. Enrichment of Rhabditidae (B1) and Diplogasteridae (B1) coupled with depletion in Filenchus (F2) characterized active and advanced decay prior to skeletonization in both cores and interface soils. Enrichment of Acrobeloides (B2), Aphelenchoides (F2), Tylencholaimidae (F4) and Seinura (P2) occurred during a narrow period in mid-skeletonization (day 153). Our study has revealed soil nematode successional patterns during vertebrate decomposition and has identified organisms that may function as indicator taxa for certain periods during decomposition.},

Two important and currently overlooked nitrogen (N) pools likely to be affected by carrion are free amino acid (FAA) and peptide pools, which are a newly recognised point of competition between plants and microorganisms for the N resource. A carcass addition experiment was established using recently ({\textless}12 h) deceased kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) carcasses to quantify soil nutrient changes in a box gum grassy woodland ecosystem. Soil samples were taken every 12 weeks, and analysed for available nutrient content and FAA and peptide turnover rates. Carcasses were a source of N, adding an average of 4.4 kg m−2 to the soils directly under the decomposing carcasses in our study, representing a significant redistribution of this resource within the ecosystem. There was also a significant and lasting input of proteins (40 mg/kg) and amino acids (25 mg/kg) into the soil, which increased microbial turnover of these labile N compounds. Dissolved organic N (DON) cycling in rangelands and natural ecosystems is an overlooked part of the N and C cycle despite representing the most important nutrient input into these systems. Based on our results, we argue for a re-think on the removal of carcasses as an ecosystem management tool, as they provide large and lasting resource islands which influence soil N cycling.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms are key decomposers of vertebrate mortalities, breaking down body tissues and impacting decomposition progress. During human decomposition, both extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic cadaver-related factors have the potential to impact microbial decomposers either directly or indirectly via altered physical or chemical conditions. While extrinsic factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) explain some variation in microbial response during human decomposition in terrestrial settings, recent work has noted that even under the same environmental conditions, individuals can have different decomposition patterns, highlighting the potential for intrinsic factors to impact microbial decomposers. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of several intrinsic factors (age, sex, diseases at time of death, and body mass index [BMI]) on chemical and microbial changes in decomposition-impacted soils. In a field study conducted at the University of Tennessee Anthropology Research Facility, soils were collected from the decomposition-impacted area surrounding 19 deceased human individuals through the end of active decomposition. Soil physicochemical parameters were measured, and microbial (bacterial and fungal) communities were assessed via amplicon sequencing. BMI was shown to explain some variation in soil pH and microbial response to human decomposition. Hierarchical linear mixed (HLM) effects models revealed that BMI category significantly explained variation in pH response within decomposition-impacted soils over time (HLM F = 9.647; P {\textless} 0.001). Additionally, the relative abundance of soil Saccharomycetes in decomposition soils under underweight donors displayed little to no changes (mean maximum change in relative abundance, +6.6\%), while all other BMI categories displayed an increased relative abundance of these organisms over time (normal, +50.6\%; overweight, +64.4\%; and obese, +64.6\%) (HLM F = 3.441; P = 0.11). Together, these results reveal intrinsic factors influencing decomposition patterns, especially within the soil environment, and suggest BMI is an important factor for controlling decomposition processes. IMPORTANCE This work begins to address questions about interindividual variation in vertebrate decomposition attributed to intrinsic factors, that is, properties of the carcass or cadaver itself. Most research on factors affecting decomposition has focused on the extrinsic environment, such as temperature or humidity. While these extrinsic factors do explain some variation in decomposition patterns, interindividual variability is still observed. Understanding how intrinsic factors influence microbial decomposers will help reveal the ecological impacts of decomposition. This work also has forensic applications, as soil chemical and biological changes have been suggested as indicators of postmortem interval. We reveal factors that explain variation in the decomposition environment that should be considered in these estimates. This is particularly important as we consider the implications of variations in human populations due to diet, age, BMI, disease, toxicological loading, etc. on forensic investigations dealing with decomposing remains.},

Changes associated with decomposition were observed, but no adipocere was formed during the initial month of decomposition for either tissue type. Early-stage adipocere formation in pig samples during later months was detected. The variable time courses for adipose tissue decomposition were attributed to differences in the distribution of total fatty acids between species. Variations in the amount of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were also detected between species. The study shows that differences in total fatty acid composition between species need to be considered when interpreting results from experimental decomposition studies using pigs as human body analogs.},

The goals of this study were to evaluate the impact of human decomposition in a multi-individual, shallow ({\textasciitilde}70 cm depth) grave on soil biogeochemistry and soil microbial and nematode communities. Three individuals were interred and allowed to decay for four years. Soils were collected from two depths (0‒5 and 30‒35 cm) along linear transects radiating from the grave as well as from within and below (85‒90 cm depth) the grave during excavation to assess how decomposition affects soil properties. Along radiating surface transects, several extracellular enzymes rates and nematode richness increased with increasing distance from the grave, and likely reflect physical site disruption due to grave excavation and infill. There was no evidence of carcass-sourced C and N lateral migration from the grave, at least at 30‒35 cm depth. Within the grave, soils exhibited significant N-enrichment (e.g., ammonium, dissolved organic N), elevated electrical conductivity, and elevated respiration rates with depth. Soil biogeochemistry within the grave, particularly in the middle (30‒35 cm) and base (70‒75 cm depth), was significantly altered by human decomposition. Mean microbial gene abundances changed with depth in the grave, demonstrating increased microbial presence in response to ongoing decomposition. Human-associated Bacteroides were only detected at the base of the grave where anoxic conditions prevailed. Nematode community abundance and richness were reduced at 70‒75 cm and not detectable below 85‒90 cm. Further, we identified certain Plectus spp. as potential indicators of enrichment due to decomposition.

Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the V4 region had a significantly higher mean Chao1 richness within the total microbiome data. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance statistical tests, based on unweighted UniFrac distances, demonstrated that taxa compositions were significantly different between V4 and V3-4 hypervariable regions (p {\textless} 0.001). Of note, we present the first study, using the largest cohort of criminal cases to date, that two hypervariable regions show discriminatory power for human postmortem microbial diversity. In conclusion, here we propose the impact of hypervariable region selection for the 16S rRNA gene in differentiating thanatomicrobiomic profiles to provide empirical data to explain a unique concept, the Postmortem Clostridium Effect.},

	abstract = {Even though automated functional annotation of genes represents a fundamental step in most genomic and metagenomic workflows, it remains challenging at large scales. Here, we describe a major upgrade to eggNOG-mapper, a tool for functional annotation based on precomputed orthology assignments, now optimized for vast (meta)genomic data sets. Improvements in version 2 include a full update of both the genomes and functional databases to those from eggNOG v5, as well as several efficiency enhancements and new features. Most notably, eggNOG-mapper v2 now allows for: 1) de novo gene prediction from raw contigs, 2) built-in pairwise orthology prediction, 3) fast protein domain discovery, and 4) automated GFF decoration. eggNOG-mapper v2 is available as a standalone tool or as an online service at http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de.},

	abstract = {Ecological filters and nutrient heterogeneity are important in the function of ecosystems. Herbaceous layers alter forest ecosystems by filtering tree species during early stages of tree reproduction and influencing nutrient cycling. Important aspects about how tree species successfully establish below and extend above this ecological filter are unanswered in forest ecology. We experimentally tested the effects of large ungulate carcasses on the filtering function of herbaceous layers. Even well-utilized carcasses created unexpected disturbances that reduced herbaceous cover, which effectively perforated the herbaceous layer filter that can differentially influence tree reproduction. Carcasses also created lasting biogeochemical “hotspots” in forest soils that may help maintain plant biodiversity by creating resource heterogeneity and shifting competitive relationships. Because the spatial distribution of carcasses is influenced by predators, these data establish an unrecognized link between large carnivores, prey carcasses, and ecosystem processes. This link supports a novel understanding of disturbance by large herbivores in forest ecosystems by demonstrating an important interaction between predator–prey functional traits and tree seedling dynamics on either side of a major ecological filter.},
